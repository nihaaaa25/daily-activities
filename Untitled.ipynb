    "#  DATA PIPELINE\n",
    "          A data pipeline is a step by step process that takes raw data and converts it into model ready data.\n",
    "### Basic flow:\n",
    "          Raw data---> Cleaniing--->processing--->model\n",
    "### Why do we need a pipeline\n",
    "          Real world / Raw data data is not clean:\n",
    "              > Missing values\n",
    "              > Duplicate records\n",
    "              > Different formats\n",
    "              > Noise and outliers\n",
    "### A data pipeline:\n",
    "          > Oraganises data properly\n",
    "          > Automates steps\n",
    "          > Reduce human errors\n",
    "          > Makes ML modelm reliable\n",
    "### Pipeline in sklearn:\n",
    "         A pipeline in sklearn is a sequence of data preproocessing steps and a machine learning model combined together \n",
    "         to automate training and prediction.\n",
    "### simple data pipeline flow:\n",
    "         Data collection--->Data preperation--->ML model training--->ML model evaluation--->ML model deployement\n",
    "### Common sources:\n",
    "         CSV / Excel files\n",
    "         APIs\n",
    "         ex: student marks data collected from a csv file\n",
    "### Data Cleaning:\n",
    "         Fixing errors and problems in data.\n",
    "### Common task:\n",
    "         Handling missing values\n",
    "         Removing duplicates\n",
    "         Fixing incorrect values\n",
    "         removing outliers\n",
    "         \n",
    "         ex: Fill missing study hours with average\n",
    "             Removve duplicates student records\n",
    "### Data preprocessing:\n",
    "         Converting data into a machine understandable format.\n",
    "### Common techniques:\n",
    "         > scaling ( StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)\n",
    "         > Encoding ( Label Encoding, One-hot Encoding)\n",
    "         > Train Test Split\n",
    "         \n",
    "         ex: Convert \"Male/Female\"-->0/1\n",
    "             Scale marks to same range.\n",
    "### Feature engineering:\n",
    "         Creating new and better features from existing data.\n",
    "### Common methods:\n",
    "         > Binning \n",
    "         > Feature creation\n",
    "         > Feature selection\n",
    "         > Feature transformation\n",
    "         Ex: Convert age--> Young/Adult/Senior\n",
    "             Create \"total marks\" from subjects marks\n",
    "### Model Training:\n",
    "         Giving processed data to a machine learning  algorithms so it can learn patterns.\n",
